# CPU Scheduling Project

This is a Flask web application that demonstrates several CPU scheduling algorithms using a class-based approach.

## Features

- FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
- SJF (Shortest Job First) – Non-Preemptive and Preemptive
- Round Robin
- Priority Scheduling – Non-Preemptive and Preemptive

## Running the App

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows

2. pip install -r requirements.txt

3. python run.py
